Fine-Tuning LLMs with Llama2

This repository contains the code for fine-tuning a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) using the Llama2 architecture. The fine-tuning process leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library along with tools such as `accelerate`, `peft`, and `bitsandbytes`.

Installation

To run this code, you need to install the necessary Python packages. These include `accelerate`, `peft`, `bitsandbytes`, `transformers`, and `trl`. Additionally, the `huggingface_hub` library is required for accessing pre-trained models and tokenizers from Hugging Face.

Model Loading

The fine-tuning process begins by loading a pre-trained Llama2 model. This involves using the `AutoModelForCausalLM` class from the Transformers library. The model is configured for 4-bit quantization to optimize memory usage, with specific settings for computation and quantization types.

Tokenizer Setup

Alongside the model, the corresponding tokenizer is also loaded and configured. The tokenizer is set up to handle the beginning and end of sentences correctly, with specific configurations for padding and tokenization.

Training Arguments

Training arguments are crucial for specifying the configuration for the fine-tuning process. These settings include the output directory, batch size, and the maximum number of training steps. These parameters ensure that the fine-tuning process runs smoothly and efficiently.

Fine-Tuning the Model

The fine-tuning process is carried out using the `SFTTrainer` class. This involves loading a custom dataset and setting up the model, tokenizer, and training arguments. The `LoraConfig` class is used to configure the fine-tuning process, allowing for efficient training on the specified task.

Generating Text

After the model has been fine-tuned, it can be used to generate text based on user prompts. A text generation pipeline is set up to handle input prompts and generate responses using the fine-tuned model.
